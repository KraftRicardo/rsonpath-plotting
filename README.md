This repository contains the result CSV files and corresponding plots generated for the **rsonpath-lut** experiments conducted as part of my masterâ€™s thesis, *"RsonPath with a Touch of DOM."*

The code used for running the experiments can be found in my fork of the RsonPath project here:  
ðŸ‘‰ [github.com/KraftRicardo/rsonpath/tree/ricardo/main](https://github.com/KraftRicardo/rsonpath/tree/ricardo/main)

The plotting scripts are located in the `python/` folder.  
Experimental data is organized in the following directories:
- `.a_extern_final_results/`: Results from performance tests run on a TUM server.
- `.a_local_results/`: Results from performance tests run on a local laptop.
